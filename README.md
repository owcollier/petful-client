# Petful

-Client for the Petful app, whose server repo is located [here](https://github.com/owcollier/petful-server)

-Working example of the client deployed on [Netlify](https://wonderful-nightingale-981bcd.netlify.com/)

Petful makes pet adoption easy & fair by providing the user with choices for pet adoption based on which animals have been at the local shelter or rescue the longest. The pets displayed for adoption selection will always be the animals who have been waiting the longest for a new, loving family or owner.

## How do I use Petful?

Upon loading up Petful, you will see a selection of pets up for adoption. View information about each pet and press adopt to adopt the pet of your choosing! V1 of Petful uses static dummy data implemented on the server-side for demonstration purposes, but further iterations of Petful would ideally source data from local animal shelters according to the user's zip code.
